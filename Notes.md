# 1. Overview of TensorFlow  
- TensorFlow is *end-to-end* open source platform for machine learning.
- **Tensor** means - multi-dimensional array and **Flow** means - graph of operations. This means it implementts ML algos as graph of operations in Multi-dimensional array.
### History
- TensorFlow developed by Google Brain.
- Release under Apache 2.0 in Nov 2015.
- Latest version of TensorFlow is 2.0. 
### Why TensorFlow
- used for build and deployment of ML models.
- supports production of ML models cpu, gpu, edge devices (routers) 
- languages support - python, Java, go programming
- TF has flexible archiecture as:
    - It enables easy deployment across hardware platforms like : CPUs, GPUs and TPUs. 
    - Also supports computing devices like dsktops, servers, mobile devices and edge devices
### Companies using TF
![TF used by following companies](C:\Learning\tensorflow\images\TFUsedby.jpg)
- Google - uses TF to better its products like gmail, docs
- Airbnb - classify images and objects from the images
- Airbus - to detect interesting objects from satellite imagery and make it available for its users
- paypal - to detect fraudalent transactions
- twitter - to ran tweets

*TF Hello world program* using [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true)
-> Colab is jupytor notebook that is used to run python programs on browser using cloud runtime (AWS I guess)
-> *Epoch* is the one complete iteration 

### Demo
- code cell vs text cell (can use markdown)
- connection to colab
- print Hello World
- Addition of 2 numbers in 1 program.
- Addition of 2 numbers step by step (initialization, addition, print result)
